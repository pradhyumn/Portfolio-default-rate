# Portfolio-default-rate
Mining actual bank data from Italy to calculate the portfolio default rate. The model intends to provide better predictions of the one-year probability of default (PD) for prospective borrowers.

# Running
To run the model as a local application, git clone this repository, and run the app.py file. To run the model on a python environment to predict the probability of default, you can run the harness.py file.

# Code
The Jupyter notebook val.ipynb contains all the steps for cleaning, EDA and training of the model. The XGB model ckpt is also uploaded as turquoise_model.bin 

# PitchDeck
This project was part of the Applied ML in Finance class for CDS NYU and NYU Stern and the presentation file explaining all the steps in the project is in Turquoise_PitchDeck.pdf.
